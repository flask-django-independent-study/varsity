# This week we are going to learn how to use Flask's Blueprint and Package system!

#### This will assist you in maintaining best practices, and staying sane when working with large projects.

Let's get started!

1. Clone into the repository:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/flask-django-independent-study/week-1-varsity-blueprints
```

2. Open the project folder and set up your virtual environment:

```zsh
python3 -m venv env
```

3. There aren't any requirements yet. This means you'll need to activate your virtual environment and install your dependencies.
We know you got this!

4. Don't forget to activate your virtual environment!

5. Follow the TODOs in the code, and finish the assignment!

### If this was just too easy, here are some stretch challenges:

  1. Refactor an existing project to use blueprints

  2. Add url_prefixes to your __init__ file and clean up your code!

  3. I don't know, make it cool! It looks super boring right now, so add styling, add more routes, make it yours!
